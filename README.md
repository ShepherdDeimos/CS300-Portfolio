# CS300-Portfolio



CS 300 - Data Structures and Algorithms Portfolio Submission
Project Summary
For this course, I completed two projects related to data structures and algorithms.

Project One: I analyzed the run-time complexity and memory usage of different data structures, evaluating their efficiency based on the problem requirements.
Project Two: I implemented an algorithm that sorts and prints out a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order. This required understanding sorting techniques and data organization.
Problem Solving Approach
The main challenge was determining which data structures best suited each problem. Data structures like linked lists, arrays, hash tables, and trees all have different performance characteristics, and selecting the right one impacts run-time efficiency and memory usage.

For sorting the courses, I needed to ensure they were ordered correctly using an efficient sorting algorithm. I implemented a method that organizes the course list in alphanumeric order, ensuring both numerical and alphabetical sorting was handled properly.

Challenges and Solutions
During the projects, I faced challenges such as:

Choosing the right data structure for sorting and searching. I overcame this by testing different structures and analyzing their performance.
Debugging sorting logic to ensure correct ordering. I solved this by using print statements to visualize the sorting process and validate outputs.
Impact on Software Development Skills
These projects helped me better understand the importance of algorithm selection in software development. I now approach programming problems by:

Carefully considering time complexity (Big O notation) before choosing a data structure.
Writing code that is modular, maintainable, and well-documented to make future modifications easier.
Using best practices for sorting and searching algorithms to optimize performance.
